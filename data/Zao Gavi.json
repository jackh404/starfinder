  "description": "Zao was raised in the underground of Daimalko with the rest of his enclave, the Gavi people.  When Zao was young his enclave's leader returned from a long journey with new powers granted to her by a mysterious orb.  The Orb was said to be gifted by the old goddess Duellona.  Zao's community had always been worshipers of Duellona, even though many others no longer believed, and praised her name when they received the new gift. The community leader told the enclave that this new orb have given her valuable insight into the locations and mindset of the Colossi creatures that had driven their people underground 150 years ago. Together the enclave decided to return to the surface and regain some of their lost freedoms. Zao had never seen the sky before but had heard many stories from the elders and was excited to return to the surface.  He immediately fell in love with the open air, and his dreams of seeing the galaxy were born. \n\nA naturally agrarian society, the Damai people of Gavi set up a farming community quickly and were able to establish a loving and familial home for themselves.  Though they could grow most things themselves, there were several crucial supplies that could only be harvested from the planet outside of their community.  Pilots were recruited to fly dangerous missions carrying miners and other workers back and forth to get these necessary goods. Zao volunteered as soon as he was old enough and was given only a basic level of training, mostly being shown how to land, take off, and keep the ship in the air, before he began flying these routes.  He has acquired most of his skills himself through trial and error on the job.  Zao also became adept at reading the land and navigating by terrestrial landmarks. He even helped draw a navigational map of the area to and from the mines to help others out. \n\nTheir leader spent most of her time split between protecting the community and training her new protégé for the day she would be ready to step down.  It was on one of these training days that the Colossi attacked. Distracted by her task of training, their leader was unable to sense the attack until it was too late. Most of the communities defenses were damaged and many of the fighting men were killed. Zao was away on a flight when the attack happened and returned to find most of his community gone, only the women and children surviving hidden away. Tired of hiding underground, and not able to rebuild with so few able bodied people left, the remainder of the Gavi enclave decided to leave Daimalko and start fresh somewhere new. \n\nZao, along with other pilots volunteered to take as many people as he could to Absalom Station, where they hoped to start a new community. Once they arrived, Zao returned his ship to the community and went his separate ways. He had lost too many friends in the attack to feel any real peace or connection to those that were left.  This is where Zao's new adventure began.\n\nWhile sitting in a bar one night, lamenting about how he wished he just had a ship then he could fly away from here, Zao met Niso. He was a skittermander who happened to have a ship. It wasn't until much later that Zao found out the ship had never actually belonged to Niso. But oh well, it was theirs now. \n\nFor months Zao and Niso flew around the galaxy picking up odd jobs here and there. they took on a few crew members and had a pretty stable business going. Zao had a strict moral code as a captain. They never took jobs that were intended to hurt others, or that appeared to be more violent than advertised.  The crew was content and they made enough money from mostly smuggling, petty theft, and the occasional bounty job.   Zao spent all his spending money on improvements to the ship and was very proud of what he was doing with his new found freedom. That was until one night when Zao came back to the ship to go to sleep, only to find the ship gone. Zao asked Niso what had happened, assuming they had been robbed or maybe the original owners had come back for it.  But no, Niso had simply given the ship away.  Much like how he had given the ship to Zao when he was in need and wanting one, Niso had come across someone else who was in need and wanting a ship of their own. So like any helpful skittermander, he gave it to them. \n\nZao was furious with Niso, but more mad at himself. He should have known better than to leave Niso with the ship unsupervised.  So after paying the crew their last wages and explaining what happened, Zao parted ways from Niso and went off to find a new ship to start over on, after all he was a pretty decent pilot. \n ",

    "description": "The people known throughout the galaxy as damais are survivors of a shattered planet who are at once hardy yet fragile, savvy yet foolish, prescient yet solipsistic. Their planet is ancient even on the scale of the vast universe, and yet for damais, modern history is merely 200 years old. Life on Daimalko, their dry, rocky planet in Near Space, transformed when an event called the Awakening wracked the land with earthquakes, evaporated the world’s oceans, and withered its greenery. Worse, the cataclysm awakened the terrible colossi at the heart of the people’s legends. Some of these monstrosities were kyokors, though many were other, equally horrific beasts, and all rose from their slumber beneath the seabed to destroy most of the planet’s inhabitants in short order.\n\nPrior to this disaster, the people of Daimalko were split between two advanced, warring societies: the holy Queendom of Ykarth, which claimed a divine mandate from the empyreal lord Duellona, and the psychic Confederation of Volkaria. But the Awakening drove most of the surviving damais underground, regardless of their allegiance, where they huddled in caverns they came to collectively call the Refuge. Nearly 150 years passed as the remaining damais and their descendants grappled with the cultural trauma of the Awakening. Originally a fragile people threaded with natural ribbons of psychic energy, empathic magic, or braids of both, damais adapted into the hardy and resourceful people they are today.\n\nAbout 50 years ago, a wise leader in one of the deepest and largest pockets of the Refuge resolved to reunite damais for good. Reirali Kokolu sought to build solidarity among the refugees despite the fact that the colossi still rampaged on the surface above. At great personal risk, she traversed the lightless caverns to make contact with other refugee settlements, inviting their leaders to travel with her until they’d contacted each surviving damai and formulated a plan to keep them connected to one another, even if only spiritually.\n\nNear the end of the leaders’ journey, they stumbled upon a curious cache of rune-scribed orbs. Though most of the leaders thought the objects mere baubles, useless remnants of the planet’s lost civilizations, Reirali Kokolu felt compelled to commune with the orbs. At first, touching them conveyed blasts of overwhelming emotion, fits of magical hubris, unnatural physical strength, and the darkest dread. However, after studying them at length—and convincing the other damai leaders to do the same—Kokolu found that the orbs, when bonded to a user, subtly conveyed vital information about the marauding colossi, such as their physical locations at any given time. Users of these orbs even seemed able to subtly influence the beasts’ behavior, though doing so caused tremendous stress, both mentally and physically. Communing with the orbs also fused the leaders to each other emotionally. As they learned to wield the orbs’ power, the leaders came to realize that with just a little concentration, they could inhabit each others’ minds and hearts.\n\nThese damai leaders became the first Guardians. Invigorated with the powers they’d unlocked, the Guardians returned to their respective settlements in the Refuge. Some died mysteriously along the way, and to this day it is unclear why, despite numerous attempts to discover the fates of these Guardians and any motive or meaning behind their deaths.\n\nHowever, the rest returned to their enclaves. While some used the orbs merely to fortify their settlements, terrified of the power of the colossi they felt through their artifacts, other Guardians began ushering small colonies of damais aboveground, carefully using their bonded orbs to shield their people from harm. Now, the underground settlements have approached a stability that is just shy of thriving, though the aboveground colonies still struggle, thanks both to their youth and to colossi attacks that their Guardians have failed to thwart. Daimalkan Guardians command great power, found both within them and through their orbs, but they are no less mortal than their kin, who age much as humans do. Thus, each Guardian carefully chooses and trains her successor over about a dozen years, using her wits, her wisdom, and her bonded orb, which she transfers to her charge when the time is right.\n\nThough some whisper that the magic flowing through the leaders is somehow tied to the force that sparked the Awakening, trust in the Guardians is nearly universal in damai settlements. Despite their different approaches to survival, the Guardians and everyday damais recognize how deeply tied to each other they are—or without the bonds of their people, damais would have nothing except the colossi that slaver for their end.\n\nThe average damai has gray skin, stands 6 feet tall, and weighs around 175 pounds.",

In addition, maps differ based on the size of the area they cover: local maps depict an area up to 1,000 square miles, regional maps depict an area up to 10,000 square miles, planetary maps depict an entire planet, and system-wide maps depict an entire star system.\n\nA map grants you a circumstance bonus to Survival checks perform the orienteering task or Piloting checks to navigate within the region detailed by the map; survey maps grant a +1 bonus, and navigational maps grant a +2 bonus. You gain the bonus for using a map only if you are traveling directly through the area depicted by the map. For instance, you gain no bonus from a planetary map when navigating on foot through the streets of a settlement, but you would gain the bonus when plotting a course to a different location on that planet.\n\nNavigational maps are based on detailed explorations. They are extremely accurate and have in-depth detail on the detailed region’s features.",
