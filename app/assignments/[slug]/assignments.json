It appeared briefly in the sightline of the Tazuni orbital telescope's viewfinder, apparently having escaped Aucturn's orbit to travel into deep space. Other Society telescopes have since successfully spotted it, suggesting that it has not changed its trajectory again since. The Forum requests that the probe be retrieved for study and data recovery to understand what caused it to lose contact and veer so far off course.",

An astronomer from House Iverach generously shared data from Radnar's last transit, indicating that the unusual radar returns from the object may make it of interest to the Society. The Forum recommends an agent or member ship equipped with advanced sensors and scanning devices be dispatched to survey Radnar's surface and take samples to assess its scientific and/or material value.

I am Dom Geyler, CEO of Apex Shipping, and I write to you today with a business concern that I believe may be of interest to a brave band of explorers and scientists. Some days ago, the Apex Yaotzin, one of our largest freighters, transited into the Drift in the Daimalko system. The driftage, which came from an unknown plane, manifested unusually close to the ship, which went dark soon thereafter. The sensor readings and recordings that were transmitted beforehand are bizarre and contradictory, and have left us concerned for the safety of the crew. It is my hope that a crew of Starfinders might visit our headquarters in Cuvacara to review the details before retracing the Yaotzin's path and investigating its disappearance.",
