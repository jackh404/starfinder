It appeared briefly in the sightline of the Tazuni orbital telescope's viewfinder, apparently having escaped Aucturn's orbit to travel into deep space. Other Society telescopes have since successfully spotted it, suggesting that it has not changed its trajectory again since. The Forum requests that the probe be retrieved for study and data recovery to understand what caused it to lose contact and veer so far off course.",

It will make this transit in approximately `6` days. It is roughly 3km long, 1km wide, and has an estimated mass of 3.93â‹…10^12kg. An astronomer from House Iverach generously shared data from Radnar's last transit, indicating that the unusual radar returns from the object may make it of interest to the Society. The Forum recommends an agent or member ship equipped with advanced sensors and scanning devices be dispatched to survey Radnar's surface and take samples to assess its scientific and/or material value.
